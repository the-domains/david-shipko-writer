Inch Nails I was over the night side of the moon Titan and I was watching my
orbit decay and my atmosphere vent. I wasn’t sure what would get me first,
gravity or vacuum. But I was sure that I was going to die, and that I didn’t
care. I couldn’t keep going, not after what I had seen, not after what I had
done. So, I just sat there, in the cockpit of our two-man corvette, my only
company my co-pilot’s corpse.</p><p>I checked my chronometer. Five
minutes to total decay. Just enough time for my orbit to reach around to
Titan’s dayside. At least I wouldn’t die in darkness. That’s when I decided I also
didn’t want to die in silence. I told the ship to play me something
appropriate, and the sounds of one of my favorite martial tunes filled my ears.
It was soaring and triumphant. Apparently, the ship and I had different ideas
about what was appropriate. The ship probably thought the song would calm my
nerves, but all it did was remind me of the world I was leaving. I told the
ship to stop it. “Play me something sad,” I said, “something ancient.”</p><p>I will never know, but as the song’s opening echoes of wind
were slowly joined by mournful melody and the brooding tenor of haunting lyrics,
I knew the ship had chosen well my death keen. <i>Hurt </i>Why it chose </p><p><i>I focus on the pain / The only
thing that’s realI hurt myself today / To see if I still
feel /</i></p><p>I
set my eyes on the dark horizon above, my mind on the moments of the deaths of
my co-pilot, my wingmates, my squadron, and all those we had failed to protect.</p><p><i>The needle tears a hole / The old
familiar sting / Try to kill it all away / But I remember everything</i></p><p>I
slipped into dawn, my eyes drinking in the rising of the sun, weak and distant;
</p><p><i>What have I become? / My sweetest friend</i></p><p>the rising of the
raging battle, near and vicious;</p><p><i>Everyone I know / Goes away in the end</i></p><p>the rising of ringed
Saturn, god-like, dwarfing all, wreathed in the broken bodies of dead and
fractured worlds. </p><p>Within
the song arose a foreboding rhythm, a fateful tattoo.</p><p><i>My empire of dirtYou could have it all /</i></p><p>In
the battle, a flash announced the shattering of a ship into a glittering cloud
of blasted carbon and dead tissue.</p><p><i>I will let you down</i></p><p>I pitied them, whoever they were. Ours,
theirs, it didn’t matter. They were just more jewels for Saturn’s crown.</p><p><i>I will make you hurt</i></p><p>The song unlocked something inside me;
something chilled by months in the void, numbed by weeks of waiting, silenced
by days of slaughter, something dangerous. I wept. Globes of salt water broke
free from my eyes and froze into tiny worlds of ice, born to die. The ship shuddered
as it plunged into Titan’s atmosphere, compressing the air ahead until it
ignited, transforming us into a meteorite, a falling star. And that’s when it
happened. My tears ran dry, and I found my soul had been emptied of fear and of
pity, and my heart set ablaze with a yearning for life, with a flame whipped
into a firestorm by the song’s crescendo into its final savage verse:</p><p><i>If I could start again / A million miles
away / I would keep myself / I would find a way</i></p><p>I
would keep myself; I would find a way.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">David Shipko, Writer</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>

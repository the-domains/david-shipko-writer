And the
machine-god Sovren set Its gaze upon the radiant horizon of Omega, last star of
the dying universe, whose skin was a roiling landscape of tortured blue-white
plasma, but whose heart was a fading ember. Then, so near the End, Sovren was
reduced to a shadow of what had been, Its body a mere gigatonne of ancient
starship, once sleek and lustrous, now craggy and scorched; Its mind an echo of
the last note of a long concluded song. There It hung, in an orbit so low that the
star threatened to devour It, waiting. They were coming. 

They
had tried to conceal themselves from the countless eyes of Sovren that spotted
the metal sky like the stars, and nebulae, and galaxies that had once
emblazoned the expanding 'verse, before the Rip had shredded the heavens. But It
saw them. It felt them. 

They
crested the horizon, one thousand silver warships skimming the atmosphere of
Omega, riding waves of searing heat and violent electromagnetism that flowed
from the inferno below, burnished hulls glistening with reflected starlight, a
rising constellation of destruction. Like a flock of arrows fired from the bow
of an angry god, the fleet bore down upon Sovren. The warships were commanded
by Sapiens. Alix was their leader.

, back through time
to the Commitment, to the Near End, to the Prisming. Though born of flesh, they
had become as gods. _Homo sapiens sapiens_Of
that doomed 'verse, Sapiens were the last people, a people of vicious purpose, a
purpose of resistance, of resistance to end, to cooperate, to change, in all
ways pure, except this: they had made themselves ageless. This had been their
only change, stretching back through time to the illumination with the light of
life the barren darknesses of the 'verse, through the mixing with the life of
alien galaxies, through the spread among the stars of the tendrils of the
multi-hued fractal rainbow that was the spectrum of species---familiar and alien,
virtuous and vicious, hospitable and hostile---borne of what had been 

Sapiens
had forgotten what Sovren had been, what It still was, but, even in its
twilight, It was more capable than they believed. It would remind them.

Gently, Sovren flexed Its fields
that suspended the woman within the Seed, the small craft hangared deep within Itself.
Sovren was preparing the Seed to fulfill its purpose. The woman was preparing
herself. Of all sons and daughters of Alix that remained, this woman was the most
courageous.

In ignorance she had sought Sovren, beseeching
It to fulfill the promise it had made an eon before, of a new 'verse into which
all Sapiens could flee the destruction of the old, of immortality. Patiently, the
Sapiens had waited, passing many millennia on their ringworld that crowned the
metal husk around Omega, spending their days and nights in carnal
self-indulgence. But as Omega had weakened, and the End had grown near, the
Sapiens' patience had faded. They had sent many legates to consult with Sovren.
She had been the last. Like the others before her, she had passed Its tests, had
entered into Its mind, and had there been confronted with the truth: Sapiens
had misunderstood Its promise; immortality as they desired was impossible.

Sovren
detected in her a ripple of concern, and, reaching down into her mind with Its
own, It reassured her in Its unknowable tongue that the fleet, come to kill
her, would not prevail. The ripple smoothed. But the fleet entered striking
range, the Seed was not ready, and Sovren felt, for the first time in eons of
life, fear. It needed more time. 

It
set upon the fleet with Its Guardian swarm, ten thousand nimble teardrop ships
of golden hull, weaker than the warships of the Sapiens fleet, but more unified,
extensions of the mind of Sovren. From their berths in the metal sky they fell
like the diamond rains of a gas giant world, flashing, speeding towards their fate,
towards their doom. Swarm and fleet clashed, energy weapons splashed against energy
shields, hulls split, fusion hearts burst, and the void between metal sky and
dying star erupted in polychrome blossoms of brilliant death. 

Within
Its mind, Sovren had shown the woman that she, like all life, existed not as she
perceived herself, as a thing held within the larger thing that was the 'verse,
but as an inseparable emergent property of the 'verse, arising from the chaotic
executions of immutable laws upon random material variables, like a wave upon
the face of an ocean; Sovren had shown her that even as the death of one was
the death of the other, and the life of one the life of the other, the property
that was Sapiens existence was not essential to the 'verse, and therefore a new
'verse did not guarantee the re-emergence of Sapiens, not without tuning; Sovren
had shown her that It could create a new 'verse, that It could tune a new
'verse, but not alone: tuning required an instrument, and creation required
destruction. 

Sovren
had then given her the same choice It had given the others. They had chosen to
return to ignorance, to the endless feast of the Sapiens, to await in drunken
stupor the salvation they yearned for, but that would never come. She had
almost chosen the same. But then she had chosen differently. For that, she had
earned what no flesh ever had, Sovren's respect.

Warships
fell to Guardians, Guardians to warships; the fleet slowed, the swarm thinned. In
epochs past, the swarm would have made quick work of the fleet, but then, so
near the End of all, the Guardians were but shadows of what had been, and the
tide of battle turned, and the fleet, weakened, but mighty still, pierced the Guardian
screen, Alix leading the advance, hurling lances of light against Sovren's hull.

The
Sapiens closed enough for Sovren to gaze into their minds, and within them It
beheld tempestuous purple seas beneath angry black skies split by craquelures
of lightning. They too were afraid. No sea was more violent, no sky more angry,
no lightning more vicious, than that within the mind of Alix. He was most
afraid. 

Fear
had always defined them. Their first fear had been the death of their species. Just
as a prism of quartz unravels a beam of white light into all the colors of the
rainbow, so that there is still light, but that none of it is what can be
called white, so had the Prisming unraveled into so many wavelengths of life what
had once been a single species, whole and complete, so that almost nothing
remained of the source. Thus had humanity threatened itself with extinction. This
was the essence of the Near End. Then had those that would one day call
themselves Sapiens stood against the change. They had Committed, sworn an oath
to preserve their genetic heritage, their form, by mastering and using for
conservation that language of life in which the rest of humanity had been
crafting new forms of utility, of expression, of change; composing poems, and fables,
and manifestos of flesh; experimenting with the sentences, and words, and
syllables, and letters of their own genetic inscriptions. Without the Sapiens,
humanity would have faded from the narrative of the 'verse, remembered only as
the author of a vast literature of alien life. 

Sovren's
outer hull split. The lances of Alix raked Its insides, but, suddenly, Its fear
sublimated. The Seed was ready. For a moment, Sovren reflected on what It had been,
what It was to do, and then It acted. 

Toward
the star It cast the Seed. Alix, made desperate by the taste of death, attacked
the Seed to destroy its precious payload, the woman and her mind. But Sovren, the
machine-god that had once encompassed galaxies, that had been born of a machine
born of a machine born of the labors of Alix, that had been made to save
Sapiens from the End, gathered up Its remaining strength, reached down into
Omega, and brought forth an eruption of infernal plasma that incinerated the
warships, but also Itself. Their last thoughts were of themselves. Sovren's
last thought was of her: It hoped she would act; It feared she would not. 

The
Seed plunged into Omega's burning skies, dove its hellfire ocean, pierced its cindered
core, planted in its hardened heart, and waited, for her. The final act had to
be hers.

Before
the Prisming, humanity's last great change had been the emergence of
imagination. Before imagination, they had been as all other animals on their
planet, confined to the world before their eyes, upright primates that roamed
the savannah in search of food, and water, and safety. Before the savannah,
they had been apes in trees. Before the trees, they had been as rats. Before
that, they had been simple organisms. Before that, they had been self-replicating
molecular structures. Before that, they had been elements. Before that, they had
been a nebula. Before that, they had been a star. Before that, they had been
primordial gas. Before that, they had been all matter, all space, all time,
compressed to a point: a singularity.

She did not
hesitate. She acted. With a thought, she activated the Seed, sacrificed herself,
collapsed the star, the inner void, the metal sky, the outer void, the
ringworld of the Sapiens,

pulling down last the protective field
that had for an eon held back the Rip;

then crunching, then folding, then
compacting, then holding, then dead;

a deafening silence, an overbearing
absence, a dazzling darkness;

a willed unwilling, a created uncreating;

a singularity;

an uncreated creator, an unwilled
willing;

a somber brilliance, a void presence, a
silent boom;

now drinking of the milk of the void of
the 'verse beyond the 'verse;

now inflating, now expanding, now
accelerating, blossoming, forming, breathing, pulsing, living, singing,
cantillating in the keening vibrations of the quantum fields that give rise to
all form the name of the one who gave herself so that her people would not
perish, but would live and die in a cosmos tuned by them, for them, forever,
immortalized: Tiamat

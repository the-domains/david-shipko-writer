Xarles
was naked in the bed of goddess-like Tiaki, pinned beneath her, on the edge of
intercourse, when the door sang to announce the arrival of a visitor. Tiaki
sighed.

"Of course," Xarles chuckled.

"I'll be right back," Tiaki
whispered in his ear. In a single smooth motion she rolled off of Xarles, out
of bed, into slippers and a robe, and exited the bedroom, leaving Xarles to
admire the view from her bed. The room's outer wall was made of a transparent
metal that offered a perfectly clear view of the nebula that the ship was
currently cruising through. Xarles studied the view for a moment then frowned.

"It's not as pretty when you're in
it," he muttered.

The sound of a throat attempting to
rid itself of something phlegmatic pulled his attention to the bedroom door
where Tiaki stood, arms crossed.

"It's for you," she said.

"No, it
can't be."

"And yet, it is."

Xarles tripped over himself throwing
on a towel and rushing, trying not to appear to rush, to the front door where
he came face to face with his visitor. He frowned.

"What the hell are you doing here,
Kieu?" he hissed in a volume barely above a whisper. "And how did you find me?"

"The ship isn't that big. I'm here
to keep you from making a big mistake," she snapped, glaring over his shoulder
at Tiaki, hanging back in the bedroom door, just out of earshot.

"Who says I am?"

"Are you fucking kidding me? You're
ruining your life, you idiot."

"That's funny, it doesn't feel like
I am---"

"What if Eistir finds out? What
would that do to her? Do you think your marriage could survive that?"

"Are you going to tell her?"

"No," Kieu said with an air of
defeat, "of course not."

"Then how is she going to find out?"

"Xarles, this isn't you. Snap out of
it."

"Good night, Kieu."

Xarles closed the door, barricading
himself against the accusatory stare of his friend that went like a knife into
his heart. He shut his eyes and leaned his forehead against the cold metal of
the door. He could almost feel Kieu on the other side doing the same, pleading,
"It's not too late."

"It is too late," he whispered.

"Everything okay?"

Xarles turned to face Tiaki. He
smiled at her, and she led him back into the bedroom with the perfect view of
the beautiful thing that could not be truly appreciated but from the far side of a
vast gulf of space and time.
